                    <h3>
                      What is Polymesh?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Polymesh is an initiative to build a purpose-built security token blockchain
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>Can you walk me through the Polymesh architecture?</h3>
                    <p>
                      It's too early for us to get into specific details of the Polymesh architecture as we are still
                      researching the benefits of a few we have selected based on their alignment with market
                      requirements. We'll certainly keep the industry updated as we hone in on architecture that is most
                      fit for purpose.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                      Why should I partner or issue a token with Polymath today if you are planning to move away from
                      the current tech stack?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      We can all agree that Security Tokens need institutions to really take off. Our goal with the
                      Polymesh blockchain initiative is to provide an infrastructure that addresses the needs of
                      institutions while still empowering participants to invest and create their own security tokens.
                      The Polymath solution that's live today on Ethereum has been used by over 100 entities who have
                      created over 120 security tokens. Among them, some have completed a fundraise, distributed their
                      tokens, and some have even distributed dividends. The current solution on Ethereum has already
                      proven itself to be market-ready for a specific class of issuers and investors. Answering this
                      question is not that simple as it is different for every issuer and it comes down to your
                      fundraising goals and deadlines, as well as your target investor profile.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What's the roadmap for Polymesh?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Absolutely not. Polymath will continue to develop and iterate our Ethereum based product. There is
                      a long list of issuers and investors for whom Ethereum was a great place to innovate, and we've
                      learnt a lot there too. We have our Polymath v3.0 release planned for Q3 2019 which introduces our
                      implementation of the ERC1400 Security Token Standard, and we don't see ourselves slowing down
                      there. We will continue to develop new modules and functionality for this product, onboard new
                      issuers, and integrate with ecosystem partners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Polymesh is about taking security tokens to the next level by delivering an environment that is
                      more suitable to large institutions and family offices. The industry needs these large players to
                      embrace security tokens for us to reach our goals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Will you stop development on Ethereum?</h3>
                    <p>
                      The POLY token will continue to be used on our Ethereum dApp and we intend for it to be usable on
                      the Polymesh blockchain. We have not finalized the Polymesh architecture, but there is no
                      intention for an alternative token to represent the protocol security incentive. There are no
                      plans for a Polymesh token sale.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                      What happens later if I tokenize using Polymath Classic now (or have already tokenized using PC)?
                      Do I need to migrate over to your new chain? How would that work? What are the costs involved?
                      What's the timeline? Is it a voluntary move or a mandatory one?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Our goal is to deliver a blockchain that allows anyone to tokenize any asset anywhere and have
                      those assets trade across multiple jurisdiction(s). We could not achieve that goal without a
                      pathway for existing assets to migrate over to Polymesh. This has been done before with the likes
                      of EOS. Exact details will be available as we get closer to the launch, but our focus is to
                      deliver a path forward for security tokens that were created on Ethereum and other significant
                      chains that want to benefit from a purpose-built Security Token blockchain.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                      How many exchanges/custodians/etc. are committed to your blockchain?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Our goal is to continue to collaborate with industry participants that are delivering core
                      services like custody, stablecoins, KYC/AML and exchange/ATS. We do not plan on doing everything
                      ourselves. Over the past 2 years we've built strong relationships with many service providers and
                      received lots of feedback from them. This official announcement of the Polymesh initiative will
                      allow us to engage more openly with industry participants and service providers about specific
                      needs and how we can incorporate these needs into a purpose-built chain.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What types of assets will you support?</h3>
                    <p>
                      We do not plan on restricting Polymesh to specific assets. In fact, we are excited to see
                      corporations launching new and innovative financial products on various blockchains. These
                      products use the blockchain to deliver value beyond what's possible with traditional systems (like
                      daily dividends, daily vesting, collateralizing securities, financial baskets which include
                      multiple asset classes, and more). Our goal is not to slow innovation, but provide it an
                      infrastructure where it can flourish.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is Charles Hoskinson's role?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Charles is a strategic advisor and is assisting with the architecture. He has built several
                      blockchains and has actively participated in multiple successful projects. Together, we are
                      iterating on multiple technical layers so we can select the one that is best suited for a
                      purpose-built security token blockchain.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Who is building Polymesh?</h3>
                    <p>
                      We have been heavily involved in the research phase for the past 6 months. However, the research
                      phase has been closer to 2 years if you include all the knowledge we've gained as pioneers in the
                      security token space. Our key people are assigned to the project and we are continuing to grow the
                      team. This public announcement will also allow us to better engage with other industry
                      participants that are looking to contribute.
